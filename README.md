# C-Metal-Bindings

This is my implementation of the Metal C Bindings which enable you to use The Metal API directly in C.
## Under Development
It is still bare bones and still under heavy maintainance and thus support for more functionality will be added periodically either on a daily basis or weekly basis.

## Report Issues
Kindly report any issues if you encounter them

## Known Issues
- Command Encoder is nil (Still investigating)
- drawable is nil (also investigating)
- No Full support for all Metal functions and data structures 

# TODO
- Configure the Makefile to build a Dynamic or Static library
- Add Full support for the entire Metal API (its a long stretch but hey!!)
