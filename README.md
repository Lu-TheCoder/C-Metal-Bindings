# C-Metal-Bindings

This is my implementation of the Metal C Bindings which enable you to use The Metal API directly in C.
## Under Development
It is still bare bones and still under heavy maintainance and thus support for more functionality will be added periodically either on a daily basis or weekly basis.

## Report Issues
Kindly report any issues if you encounter them
